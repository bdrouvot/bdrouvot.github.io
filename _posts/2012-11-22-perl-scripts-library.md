A small post to let you know that this [page](http://bdrouvot.wordpress.com/perl-scripts-2/ "Perl Scripts") has been added to the blog.

This page reference all the perl scripts that will be used into this Blog and each of them will be linked to  a practical case.

As the main purpose of the blog is to share experience, you can <span style="color:#0000ff;">get the source code</span> of the scripts (explanation into the page).

I hope this will be useful for you.
