A small post to let you know that this [page](http://bdrouvot.wordpress.com/perl-scripts-2/ "PerlÂ Scripts")&nbsp;has been added to the blog.

This page reference all the perl scripts that will be used into this Blog and each of them will be linked to &nbsp;a practical case.

As the main purpose of the blog is to share experience, you can get the source code of the scripts (explanation into the page).

I hope this will be&nbsp;useful&nbsp;for you.
