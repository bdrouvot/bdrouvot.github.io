On April 1 2015, I'll start working for the Accenture Enkitec Group. No, this is not a joke for the Fool's day and I can't still believe it. Why?, because:

-   Lot of people from whom I learned (and still learn) and for whom I have admiration for are working for this group.
-   I had the chance to meet and/or communicate through social media with: [Andy Colvin](http://blog.oracle-ninja.com/), [Kerry Osborne](http://kerryosborne.oracle-guy.com/), [Karl Arao](https://karlarao.wordpress.com/), [Frits Hoogland](https://fritshoogland.wordpress.com/), [Carlos Sierra](http://carlos-sierra.net/), [Mauro Pagano](http://mauro-pagano.com/), [Tanel Poder](http://blog.tanelpoder.com/), [Martin Bach](https://martincarstenbach.wordpress.com/) and Veronica Stigers: They are all good, humble person and you can feel the passion when they talk about their jobs.
-   I see this group as an oracle community: Always happy to share their knowledge, to help and to share free tools (recent examples are: [edb360](http://carlos-sierra.net/2014/07/27/edb360/) and [SQLd360](http://mauro-pagano.com/2015/02/16/sqld360-sql-diagnostics-collection-made-faster/)).
-   If you know me and you read [this](http://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-to-expand-its-oracle-engineered-systems-capabilities-with-acquisition-of-enkitec.htm), then you should understand why I feel so happy.

I spent the last 3 years working at the European Commission (Data Center). I really enjoyed this job. But as you understood, working for the Accenture Enkitec Group is something that I can't refuse!

This post is not about self-promoting (I am not a big fan of it) me or the company, it is just a dump of my mind and feelings.

Looking forward to start this new challenge!
