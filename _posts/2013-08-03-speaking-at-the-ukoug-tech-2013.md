Some months ago I submitted 3 abstracts for the UKOUG Tech 2013 that will take place in Manchester, UK from December 2 to December 4, 2013:

1.  One to present some examples usage of [R](http://www.r-project.org/) with the Oracle Database.
2.  One to present in a live demo my [exadata utility](http://bdrouvot.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/exadata-real-time-metrics-extracted-from-cumulative-metrics-part-ii/ "Exadata real-time metrics extracted from cumulative metrics:  Part II").
3.  One to present in a live demo my [asmiostat utility](http://bdrouvot.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/asm-io-statistics-utility-v2/ "ASM I/O Statistics Utility V2").

I have been also a volunteer to participate in judging. During the judging I saw ton of quality submissions, some of them made by famous people. Then after the judging I was prepared to get my abstracts rejected and so to stay home.

Last week, I had the honor to get one of my abstract accepted (The R one) and the 2 others in the reserve list.

So, I am very **surprised, honored and happy** to be speaking at UKOUG Tech 2013.

-   **Surprised **as I was prepared to stay home.
-   **Honored **as the UKOUG is a great event (I have heard only good comments about this event).
-   **Happy **as I will be able to share my work and **last but not least I'll learn a lot** from all the person that will be there.

Finally, this will be my first presentation and that's a little bit scary ;-)

Hope to see you there !
