As you know Oracle Data Guard provides high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery. It provides a comprehensive set of services that create, maintain, manage, and monitor one or more standby databases.

If you begin working with Data Guard and you want to learn quickly, I would like to mention a book around this area that I just finished to review:

**Oracle Data Guard 11gR2 Administration Beginner's Guide**

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/oracle-data-guard-image.jpg" width="500" height="617" alt="Oracle data guard image" />](http://bdrouvot.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/oracle-data-guard-image.jpg)

This book has been written by [Emre Baransel](http://emrebaransel.blogspot.fr/) and [Nassyam Basha](http://www.oracle-ckpt.com/).

From my point of view this is a very good book to start around this subject. It is easy to read and provides also useful real-word practices and issues.
