Imagine you need to ensure that one of your many&nbsp;RAC One Node database:

1. Should re-start&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;on the current node in case of database or node crash.
2. Does not relocate&nbsp;automatically on other nodes.

So, you need somehow to "stick" this particular RAC One Node database to one node of your cluster.

For a good understanding of what RAC One Node is, you can have a look to [Martin's post](http://martincarstenbach.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/rac-one-node-and-database-protection/).

Disabling the database will not help as it will not satisfy the second point&nbsp;mentioned above.

To answer this need, I'll modify one property of the database's server pool (database is administrator managed):

To which pool belongs the db ?

```
crsctl status resource ora.BDTO.db -p | grep -i pool SERVER\_POOLS=ora.BDTO
```

Which servers are part of this pool ?

```
crsctl status serverpool ora.BDTO -p | grep -i server SERVER\_NAMES=bdtnode1 bdtnode2
```

Modify the server pool to "stick" the database to one node (bdtnode2 for example):

```
crsctl modify serverpool ora.BDTO -attr SERVER\_NAMES="bdtnode2" crsctl status serverpool ora.BDTO -p | grep -i server SERVER\_NAMES=bdtnode2
```

Now the BDTO RAC One Node database:

- will not be re-started&nbsp;automatically on node bdtnode1 in case bdtnode2 crash.
- will be re-started&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;on node bdtnode2 as soon as it will be again available.

Remarks:

1. If the server pool "host" many databases, all of them will be affected by the change.
2. If you try to relocate manually the database on the "excluded" node:

```
srvctl relocate database -d BDTO -n bdtnode1
```

It will be done and the "excluded" bdtnode1 will be again member of the server pool (as a consequence the database is not sticked to bdtnode2 anymore).

If you need another behaviour (create a preferred node), then you have to change the PLACEMENT attribute of the database ([see this post](http://bdrouvot.wordpress.com/2012/12/20/rac-one-node-create-preferred-node/ "Rac One Node : Create preferredÂ node")).

**Conclusion:** The purpose of this post is not to explain why you could choose to stick one RAC One Node database to a particular node of your cluster, it just provide a way to do so :-)
