A quick post to share the presentations I did during [UKOUG TECH 13](http://www.tech13.ukoug.org/).

- [Exadata real time metrics extraction](http://www.slideshare.net/BertrandDrouvot/exadata-real-time-ukoug-2013) (It was a live demo so there is not a lot of slides).
- [Examples of R usage with the oracle database](http://www.slideshare.net/BertrandDrouvot/example-r-usage-for-oracle-dba-ukoug-2013).

It was my first time presenting, I really enjoyed it (even if it was a little bit scary :-) ). For sure I will try to renew this experience.
